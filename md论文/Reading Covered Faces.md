Abstract
Covering faces with masks, due to mandatory pandemic safety regulations, we can no longer rely on the habitual daily-life
information. This may be thought-provoking for healthy people, but particularly challenging for individuals with
neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Au fait research on reading covered faces reveals that: 1) wearing
masks hampers facial affect recognition, though it leaves reliable inferring basic emotional expressions; 2) by buffering
facial affect, masks lead to narrowing of emotional spectrum and dampen veridical evaluation of counterparts; 3) masks
may affect perceived face attractiveness; 4) covered (either by masks or other veils) faces have a certain signal function
introducing perceptual biases and prejudices; 5) reading covered faces is gender- and age-specific, being more challenging
for males and more variable even in healthy aging; 6) the hampering effects of masks on social cognition occur over the
globe; and 7) reading covered faces is likely to be supported by the large-scale assemblies of the neural circuits far beyond
the social brain. Challenges and limitations of ongoing research and parallels to the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test are
assessed. Clarification of how masks affect face reading in the real world, where we deal with dynamic faces and have
entrée to additional valuable social signals such as body language, as well as the specificity of neural networks underlying
reading covered faces calls for further tailored research.

Introduction
Social signals conveyed by dynamic bodies and faces are vital
for efficient social cognition and intact interpersonal interaction
(e.g., de Gelder et al. 2010; Sokolov et al. 2011, 2020; Atkinson et
al., 2012; Kret and de Gelder 2012; Pavlova, 2012, 2017a, 2017b;
Pelphrey et al. 2014; van den Stock et al. 2015; Di Giorgio et al.
2017; Pavlova et al., 2017; Tillman et al. 2019; Jack et al. 2021).
Yet, we remain in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our
daily-life social cognition is no longer taken for granted. Cover-
ing faces with masks, due to mandatory pandemic safety regula-
tions, we are unable to rely on the habitual information. Instead,
we are forced to pick and pool together social signals from differ-
ent sources such as eyes (without faces hidden behind masks)
and bodies. This is thought-provoking even for healthy people
(Freud et al. 2020; Nestor et al. 2020; Martinelli et al. 2021), but
may be particularly challenging for individuals with neuropsy-
chiatric and neurologic conditions such as autism spectrum
disorders (ASD), depression, anxiety, frontotemporal dementia
or Alzheimer’s disease, and for individuals born preterm (van
den Stock et al. 2020; Gil and Arroyo-Anlló 2021; Khan et al. 2021;
Pavlova et al. 2021; Rankin 2021).
As a replacement for routine reliance on the benefits of
friendly open smiles for establishing camaraderie, we have to
explore other, often rather subtle social signals. Wearing face
masks represents not only one of simple protective tools against
contamination (Parida et al. 2020) but also a substantial psy-
chological burden for nonverbal social communication requiring

reading faces with a hidden lower part. Covering face parts
of both counterparts of interpersonal interaction may reduce
social contagion, bonding, and emotional mimicry. Wearing face
masks may lessen empathic responses to emotional states of
others. Moreover, it is demanding to accurately read the facial
expressions of others and simultaneously keep hidden our own
feelings (Schneider et al. 2013). In line with this, reading emo-
tions of others is associated with recognition of feelings in
oneself (Israelashvili et al. 2019). Differentiation between true
(also known as “Duchenne”) and fake (“Botox, Pan Am”) smiles is
based on complementary streams of information from the upper
and lower face parts (Hess and Bourgeois 2010; Eisenbarth and
Alpers 2011). This information flow may be impaired by masks,
resulting in misinterpretation of social signals and nonefficient
interaction. This is of societal value, since people with true
smiles are usually estimated as authentic, genuine, attractive,
and trustworthy (Gunnery and Ruben 2016; Galinsky et al. 2020),
whereas, by contrast, fake smiles hinder interpersonal inter-
action: better no smile at all than a fake smile. In general, in
faces covered by masks, emotions with positive valence become
less recognizable, whereas negative emotions are believed to be
augmented (Spitzer 2020).
In medical practice, covering faces by masks dampens social
interaction (Wiesmann et al. 2021). For instance, wearing masks
by medical consultants in public primary care reduces per-
ceived empathy with a far more pronounced negative impact
on already established doctor–patient relationships (Wong et al.
2013). Mask-to-mask (or more precisely, eyes-to-eyes instead of
face-to-face) clinical interaction calls for special skills in eye
reading, in particular, in psychiatric and pediatric health care
(Wild and Kornfeld 2021). In this connection, the question arises:
Which evidence on reading covered faces is offered by rigorous
experimental research?
Reading Covered Faces: Accuracy,
Misinterpretation, and Perceptual Bias
A substantial reduction in recognition of faces partly hidden
by medical masks is predicted by pre-COVID-19 research on
visual processing of faces with an occluded lower area or with
removed or hidden face elements (Bassili 1979; Stephan and
Caine 2007; Blais et al. 2012; Dhamecha et al. 2014). Covering
faces with masks decreases performance on the Cambridge Face
Memory Test with high individual variability alongside a clear
disadvantage for male observers (Freud et al. 2020). Superimpos-
ing surgical masks over the faces (i.e., making the lower part
of a face occluded) has a large detrimental effect leading to
lessening in face matching for both familiar and unfamiliar faces
(Carragher and Hancock 2020; Noyes et al. 2021). This indicates
difficulties in face re-identification, exemplifying well-known
drives for covering faces by lawbreakers.
Covering the lower part of a face not only disrupts its holistic
processing but also can affect a predisposition for detecting a
coarse face scheme (such as two eyes above a mouth) emerging
early in lifespan or considered to be hardwired in the brain
of humans, nonhuman primates, domestic chicks, and even in
species without parental care (Rosa-Salva et al. 2010; Taubert et
al. 2017; Reid et al. 2018; Buiatti et al. 2019; Versace et al. 2020). In
the absence of the lower part, the face scheme and correspond-
ing releasers are presumably not activated. In line with this,
tuning to a coarse face scheme in face-like Face-n-Food (slightly
bordering on imaginative portraits by Giuseppe Arcimboldo) and
Face-n-Thing images is orientation-specific (Pavlova et al. 2020)
and is substantially lower in neuropsychiatric and neurodevel-
opmental conditions such as ASD, schizophrenia, and Williams
and Down syndrome (Pavlova et al. 2016a, 2016b, 2017, 2018; Rolf
et al. 2020).
In general, the lower region of a face is considered to be
pivotal in the recognition of happiness and disgust, the upper
region in the recognition of anger and fear, and both are vital
for recognition of surprise and sadness. This holds true also
for moving faces and point-light faces represented as a set of
light dots on moving dark-colored faces (Bassili 1979). For most
emotional expressions, complementary streams of information
from the upper and lower face parts are required, though under
natural conditions observers usually have access to a plentiful
amount of facial information.
Several recent online studies focus on reading covered faces.
By using static photographs of faces (from the Karolinska

covered by masks with the help of Photoshop software, Italian
observers have been shown to be quite proficient in inferring
basic emotions (such as anger, happiness, and fear) with
pronounced gender differences: females rate negative emotions

as more negative and positive emotions as more positive than
males (Calbi et al. 2021). Similar to situations when whole
faces are seen, females indicate a greater desirable physical
distance from and longer interpersonal distance (less close
social bonding) with persons, in particular, males, with angry
and ambiguous eyes (Calbi et al. 2021). Face masks not only
hamper the categorization of basic emotions of both positive
and negative valence, but happy expressions are often mistaken
for neutral expressions (a “poker face”), and neutral expressions
misperceived as sad expressions (Marini et al. 2021; Fig. 1).
Moreover, this study shows that masks increase trust scores
assigned to untrustworthy unmasked faces.
In line with this, in an internet-based study with computer-
generated characters, a cohort of French participants predom-
inated by women (457 in total/323 females) choose a shorter
appropriate for them interpersonal distance with covered neu-
tral faces than with unmasked neutral, happy, or angry ones
(Cartaud et al. 2020). Estimated interpersonal distance is gener-
ally shorter with female than male posers. It is even more petite
in participants either infected with COVID-19 or living in low-
risk areas, while it is not affected by the predicted health of pro-
tagonists. Neutral characters wearing masks are judged as more
trustworthy than with whole-face emotional expressions (angry,
neutral, or happy), more threatening and less healthy than with
whole-face happy expressions, and more strong-minded than
with whole-face happy or neutral expressions (but less strong-
minded than those with angry faces). Similarly, Colombian per-
ceivers (1078 participants/821 females) judge mask wearers as
more trustworthy and socially desirable, although unhealthier
than the same unmasked posers (Olivera-La Rosa et al. 2020).
This outcome reflects a certain perceptual bias in processing of
faces covered by medical masks.
Face masks confuse German observers in reading emotions:
covering by masks basic facial expressions decreases recogni-
tion of all (in particular, disgust and happiness) except for neu-
tral and fearful expressions (Carbon 2020; Fig. 2; unmasked faces
are from the MPI FACES database). In addition, disgusted faces
are often misinterpreted as being angry, and other emotions are
misread as neutral expressions. Notably, inferring emotions cov-
ered by masks remains still far above chance, though confidence
in one’s own assessment becomes lower (Carbon 2020). Masks
not only diminish the ability to accurately categorize negative
facial affect (more in men) but also buffer the impact of negative
facial emotions on estimation of trustworthiness, likability, and
closeness (Grundmann et al. 2021).
In a sample of German perceivers (165 adults/86.1% females,
53.9% reported to have been under psychiatric treatment at
least once in life, and 22.4% under ongoing treatment), mask
wearing results in lower evaluation of trustfulness and hap-
piness than the same unmasked calm facial expressions with
a straight gaze. The negative bias elicited by medical masks
is stronger in those participants who attribute lower protec-
tive potential to masks, feel higher burden of wearing them,
wear masks infrequently, and experience a higher level of psy-
chological distress (Biermann et al. 2021). In accord with this,
college students enrolled in a large public southeastern US
university who are compliant with guidelines of mask wearing
have higher scores for initiation and maintenance of mask
wearing, participatory dialogue, behavioral confidence, emo-
tional transformation, practice for change, changes in the social
environment, and significantly lower scores for disadvantage
(Davis et al. 2021).
In the pre-COVID-19 period (where wearing masks was
already not uncommon in Japan), covering female and male
faces by a sanitary mask (and other occluders) reduced perceived
attractiveness of good-looking faces (Miyazaki and Kawahara
2016; Fig. 3). Occlusion of the lower part of a face by masks
lessens visibility of symmetry, contours, and other cues known
to contribute to the perception of face attractiveness [e.g.,
both Caucasian and Japanese perceivers prefer (rate as more
attractive) feminized faces with a round shape and a small
nose over average female and male faces (Perrett et al. 1998; see
also Pavlova et al. 2016b)]. In turn, covering makes unfavorable
features invisible, though only occluders other than masks

increase attractiveness of less-attractive faces. Both attractive
and nonattractive faces are perceived as unhealthier and more
vulnerable to illness (e.g., respiratory allergy) when covered by
a sanitary mask (Miyazaki and Kawahara 2016). Two factors
(occlusion and unhealthiness bias elicited by a sanitary mask)
interact with each other constituting “the sanitary-mask effect”
(Miyazaki and Kawahara 2016; Kamatani et al. 2021a). In
Japanese population, faces covered by black masks are reported
to be perceived more negative compared with masks of white
color perceptually symbolizing pollution or purity, respectively
(Kamatani et al. 2021b). The COVID-19 pandemic has led to
a decrease in unhealthiness ratings of masked faces (both
perceived and imagined), presumably because the attitudes
toward mask wearing are changing. Now mask wearing is
associated merely with the mutual protection of community
members, prevention of COVID-19 viral spread, and compliance
with social norms rather than with personal health conditions
solely (Kamatani et al. 2021a). Nevertheless, covered by medical
masks faces are still perceived unhealthier than unmasked ones.
Yet, in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effect of a
mask on face attractiveness has remained basically unchanged.
Mask wearing results in decreasing attractiveness ratings
of good-looking faces (as before the pandemic), though the
attractiveness ratings of nonattractive faces increase, seemingly
because the disadvantageous effect of masks becomes not so
noticeable (Kamatani et al. 2021a). These effects are independent
of mask color (white or black).
In UK residents, facial affect recognition is modulated
stronger by wearing masks than sunglasses. In particular,
identification of angriness, fear, disgust, happiness, and surprise
(but not sadness and neutral expressions) is substantially poorer
on faces covered by masks, whereas wearing sunglasses affects
primarily recognition of anger and fear (Noyes et al. 2021; Fig. 4).
Yet, the effect of face covering is less noticeable in experts, that
is, in individuals highly skilled at recognition of unconcealed
faces (Noyes et al. 2021). Therefore, the negative influence of
mask wearing on face perception and recognition may become
weaker with practice.
Finally, in accord with our expectations (see Introduction),
in covered by masks faces, social (or “fake”) smiles (typically
defined by motion of the mouth solely) become nonsmiles,
whereas real “Duchenne” smiles (defined by both the eyes and
mouth) are rated significantly less happy and more often mis-
perceived as neutral expressions than unmasked smiles (Shel-
don et al. 2021). Moreover, although both (fake and real) masked
smiles are rated as displaying more disgust than the unmasked
versions, perceived disgust is greater for fake smiles. Yet, the
glow of real smiles still shows: even covered real smiles are rated
as happy and pleasant (Sheldon et al. 2021).
In summary, the studies available indicate:
1. Reduction in facial affect recognition. Wearing a medical
mask profoundly hampers facial affect recognition accuracy
(the effect sizes depend on the particular emotion), though
it leaves inferring basic emotional expressions above chance
level (Carbon 2020; Cartaud et al. 2020; Olivera-La Rosa et al.
2020; Ruba and Pollak 2020; Biermann et al. 2021; Calbi et al.
2021; Gori et al. 2021; Grundmann et al. 2021; Marini et al.
2021; Noyes et al. 2021). Substantial reduction in detection
and recognition of facial affect may not only have a profound
impact on daily-life social interaction but also on a wide
range of professional activities such as evaluation of patients
in psychiatric clinical practice, pediatric health care, and
schooling.
2. Narrowing of perceived emotional spectrum. Lessening
in recognition accuracy and perceived intensity of facial
signals as well as recognition errors (mistaking one facial
expression for another) may lead to narrowing of emotional
spectrum of social interaction. In covered by masks faces,
with a high probability, expressions with both positive and
negative valence may be misperceived as neutral (Carbon
2020; Cartaud et al. 2020; Marini et al. 2021).
3. Deceptive evaluation of counterparts. Most essential, by

facial

masks
often
dampen
veridical
evaluation of counterparts and lead to deceptive impressions
and subsequent inefficient or even potentially hazardous
interpersonal interaction. In particular, covering negative
emotions can result in intensifying perceived trustwor-
thiness and likability that leads to sinking physical and
interpersonal distances (Olivera-La Rosa et al. 2020; Grund-
mann et al. 2021). In turn, cushioning positive emotional
signals, such as true smiles, and differentiation between
true and false positive signals (e.g., real and fake smiles) may
lead to multiple hitches in establishing social contacts in
professional settings (Sheldon et al. 2021; Wiesmann et al.
2021).
4. Impact on perceived face attractiveness. Face masks may
affect perceived face attractiveness, resulting in a decrease in
attractiveness ratings of good-looking female and male faces
and an increase in attractiveness ratings of nonattractive
faces, independently of a possible symbolic function of mask
color (Kamatani et al. 2021a).
5. Perceptual bias. Faces covered by masks have a certain signal
function introducing a perceptual bias or prejudices (such
as “mask wearers are socially desirable and responsible”)
that should be in view when considering the mask impact
on social interaction. The influence of face masks on social
cognition is modulated by a number of factors such as beliefs
in protective masks effects and psychological distress (Bier-
mann et al. 2021). For instance, the effect of masks on per-
ceived attractiveness can be profoundly modulated by prej-
udices toward medical masks (such as “mask wearers may
be unhealthy”), which have become weaker in the course of
the COVID-19 pandemic as masks are merely associated with
mutual protection of community members and compliance

with social norms (Kamatani et al. 2021). Symbolic meanings
of masks as well as fundamental attitudes and beliefs toward
mask wearing may affect social behavior at large (Davis et al.
2021; Timpka and Nyce 2021).
Reading Covered Faces: Development, Gender,
and Aging
Little is known about developmental impact on reading covered
faces, and the findings are not only sparse, but controversial.
On one hand, the effect of masks on face reading is reported
to be modulated by observers’ age: children less than 9 years
old are unimpaired in classification of basic facial expressions
(Roberson et al. 2012). This dovetails well with the recent report
that both deaf (and hard-of-hearing) and typically hearing 6-
year-olds pay most attention to the eye region when reading
faces expressing basic emotions (Tsou et al. 2020). In racially
diverse school-age (7- to 13-years) children, covering faces (taken
from the Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expressions of Emotion
database) by masks or sunglasses degrades to equal degree infer-
ring basic emotions with negative valence (sadness, fear, and
anger), though recognition accuracy is modulated by emotion
type (Ruba and Pollak 2020). Yet in childhood, reliable recognition
remains possible even when faces are partly covered (Ruba and
Pollak 2020). Although face masks affect the ability to infer/label
emotions (as well as lead to mistaking one emotion for another)
in all age groups (3–5-year-olds, 6–8-year-olds, and adults) of
Italian neurotypical participants, difficulties in inferring emo-
tions are significantly more pronounced in children aged 3–
5 years (Gori et al. 2021). Older children (aged 6–8 years) are
also stronger affected by masks than adults. These findings
suggest a potential influence of mask wearing on development
of essential social skills such as reading faces, in particular,
during transient sensitive periods.
The impact of a face mask on perception and under-
standing of social signals appears to be gender-specific and
age-dependent for both perceivers and posers: reading of
covered by masks faces is more challenging for males and in
elderly as well as in male and older posers (Carbon 2020; Calbi
et al. 2021; Grundmann et al. 2021).
Reading Covered Faces: Cross-Cultural
Aspects
The hindering effect of face masks on social cognition (face
reading and social judgments such as estimation of personal
traits and social distances) appears to occur all over the globe: by
now, evidence has been collected in Italian (Calbi et al. 2021; Gori
et al. 2021; Marini et al. 2021), German (Carbon 2020; Biermann et
al. 2021; Grundmann et al. 2021), Colombian (Spanish-speaking;
Olivera-La Rosa et al. 2020), French (Cartaud et al. 2020), UK
(Roberson et al. 2012; Noyes et al. 2021), Dutch (Fischer et al.
2012; Kret and de Gelder 2012; Kret and Fischer 2018; Kret et
al. 2021), Japanese (Kamatani et al. 2021a), and United Arab
Emirates (Kret et al. 2021) cohorts of people as well as in racially
diverse children in the USA (Ruba and Pollak 2020). Some parts of
the world are more experienced with covered faces: for example,
Singapore and Hong Kong suffered flu pandemics in the 1950s
and 1960s, while China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were troubled
by the SARS outbreak of the early 2000s with mandatory mask
wearing (Johns 2020).
Skills for reading faces covered by masks appear to be shaped
not only by experience but also by culture as well as by their
interaction, and one can expect that people accustomed to
partly veiled faces may be less impaired. The other way around,
cultural context can influence reading covered faces. Covering
faces by a niqab leaving only a region around the eyes open
worsens the recognition of happiness and sadness as compared
with full-seen faces of females wearing a hijab, whereas inten-
sive negative emotions (fear and anger) are well perceived by
Western (Dutch) observers also in covered faces (Fischer et al.
2012; Kret and de Gelder 2012). This agrees with the importance

Figure 5. Perceptual bias in reading covered faces. Top: Faces expressing emotions covered either by a Western headdress (a cap-and-scarf) or by a niqab (top, left).
Though both Western and Islamic headresses leave the same amount of visible information available, faces covered by a niqab are perceived by Dutch observers as
less happy and tend to be interpreted as more fearful (top, right). From Kret and de Gelder (2012), the Creative Commons Attribution [CC BY] license. Bottom: Faces

of the eye region for fear expressions (Vuilleumier 2005). Infer-
ring fear is not substantially affected even by wearing a burqa
with only 20% or 10% of transparency, while happiness and
sadness are poorly recognized under these conditions. Remark-
ably, there is a strong culturally induced bias in reading covered
faces. Regardless of attitudes toward Islam and general anxiety
level, faces covered by a niqab are perceived as less happy and
more fearful than covered by a Western headdress (a cap-and-
scarf), though the same amount of facial information is available
(Kret and de Gelder 2012; Fig. 5). Similarly, the recognition of
briefly presented (40 ms) happiness is more accurate when
faces are covered by Western compared with Islamic head-
resses (a niqab or turban), and sadness is recognized faster as
well as more often erroneously assigned to a face covered by
an Islamic headdress (Kret and Fischer 2018). However, face
covering does not affect the recognition of angriness, as cues
signaling this emotional expression (such as furrowing of the
brow) are available primarily from the upper face part. These
effects are not modulated by oxytocin (Kret and Fischer 2018),
an evolutionarily ancient neuropeptide known to facilitate social
cognition.
A general effect of a headdress occurs not only in neu-
rotypical individuals but also in patients with major depres-
sive disorder (MDD) of different severity: wearing a cap-and-
scarf facilitates recognition of happiness, whereas an Islamic
headdress enables a better identification of sadness and fear
(Liedtke et al. 2018). MDD patients are slower but not less accu-
rate than neurotypical controls. Wearing different types of face
covering may introduce certain perceptual biases. For example,
British students (Caucasian, non-Muslim) express more negative
attitudes toward a British Muslim woman wearing veils com-
pared with “no veil” conditions, and more negative attitudes
toward the full-face veil relative to the hijab (Everett et al. 2014).
Notably, covering the mouth areas (either by a niqab or censoring
black bars) leads to greater perceived anxiety in both Dutch
participants and individuals from the United Arab Emirates,
with less intense perception of happiness and anger (Kret et al.
2021). Yet, the same work shows that faces covered by a niqab
yield lower emotional intensity ratings than those covered by
black bars.
Challenges and Limitations
For several reasons, the outcome of the overviewed research
should be taken with caution. First of all, most current
experimental work on reading covered faces has been conducted
during the ongoing pandemic and, therefore, often represents
online research with its well-known advantages (such as
relatively large sample sizes, demographic diversity, fast data
collection), but also with a number of limitations (a general lack

of experimenters’ control over the settings including lighting
conditions, distractions, misunderstanding or misinterpreting
the instructions by participants, difficulties in debriefing,
prescreen lies, and ethical issues). In addition, the studies
may mainly engage individuals with specific computer skills,
interests in online information search, and access to necessary
equipment, creating

bias. Second, cohorts
of
participants in many analyzed studies are heavily predominated
by females that can potentially lead to an unbalanced study
design and some issues with statistical data analysis. For
instance, if one subgroup (females) is substantially larger than
the other (males), gender comparisons may lead to paradoxical
statistical outcomes and preclude proper generalizations of
findings.
Displayed versus Natural Emotions
In images and photographs routinely used in experimental set-
tings and face databases, facial affect is either clearly expressed
or even exaggerated (Figs 1–4). Moreover, facial emotions are
displayed either by professionals (performers and actors) or
posers who had been 1) asked and 2) trained to express emo-
tions. These expressions may turn out to be rather different
from the natural feelings we experience and express in real life
[but see Israelashvili et al. 2021 showing that natural emotional
expressions used in the Emotional Accuracy Test are comparable
(and correlated) with the Geneva Emotion Recognition Test and
Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), even when controlling
for verbal intelligence quotient]. In naturalistic environments,
however, we are usually quite far from extreme affect demon-
strations. Instead, perceivers often deal with subtle expressions
that are more difficult to detect and categorize. In daily life,
therefore, the impact of mask covering on efficient face reading
may be even more pronounced.
Basic versus Complex Emotions
Most research on reading covered faces deals with basic
emotional expressions such as happiness, angriness, or fear.
In daily life, however, emotions are multifaceted and often
ambiguous, leading to an increase in individual variability in
face reading. For example, we can simultaneously feel and
express sadness and happiness: . . . “I feel sad and light; this
sadness of mine is bright . . . ,” Aleksandr S. Pushkin (1829) “Upon
the hills of Georgia” https://www.best-poems.net/alexander-
pushkin/upon-the-hills-of-georgia.html. Yet, individuals who
are proficient in reading of basic emotions even in covered
faces may potentially exhibit more difficulties in understanding
complex multidimensional feelings and mental states.
Artificial Superimposing of Masks on Faces
For purposes of controlled rigorous experimental research,
masks are usually superimposed on face photographs by using
graphics softwares. In real life, mask wearers may express
emotions in a different way, trying to avoid misperception
or social distress of counterparts. Furthermore, people may
feel high burden of mask wearing and experience discomfort
(e.g., difficulties to breathe or articulate) or psychological
distress that, in turn, may affect both how mask wear-
ers express their emotions and affective states and how
they perceive emotional expressions of counterparts with
covered faces.
Dynamic versus Static Faces
In daily life, instead of static face snapshots, we deal with
dynamic faces that are much more informative and less ambigu-
ous. Too little is known about reading dynamic faces, in partic-
ular, covered by masks. Clarification of the impact of wearing
masks in naturalistic environments calls for tailored experimen-
tal research.
Beyond Faces
In daily-life social interaction, we have entrée to additional rich
sources of nonverbal information such as body language (de
Gelder et al. 2010; Sokolov et al., 2011, 2018, 2020; Pavlova 2012;
Krüger et al. 2013). The advantage of bodily expressions is that
whereas face expressions (similar to a verbal information flow)
are believed to be easily kept under control, body movements
reveal our true feelings and dispositions. Moreover, when social
signals from faces and bodies are dissimilar, face reading is
dominated by body language reading (Meeren et al. 2005). In real
life, we usually deal with plentiful and often abundant social
information that helps to prevent paying high costs for non-
adaptive or misleading social interaction. The present analysis
focuses on nonverbal social cognition leaving other sources of
information (such as prosody) as well as interaction between
visual and auditory modalities beyond consideration. Yet in
Czech Republic, after a month of reduced access to lip-reading
due to mandatory face mask wearing, reliance on other visual
cues substantially increased for older persons (Chládková et
al. 2021). In addition, one has to bear in mind that the use
of protective face masks affects the intelligibility and overall
communication: people have to speak with alterations in the
perceptual features of their voice, with huskiness and voice
volume affected most frequently. In turn, these effects likely
impact face perception, emotion recognition, and social interac-
tion (Karagkouni 2021; Yi et al. 2021). Speaking clearly and reduc-
ing acoustic noise can help compensate for the loss of intelli-
gibility due to the lack of visual cues and physical distancing
(Smiljanic et al. 2021).
Neural Engagement in Reading Faces Covered by Masks
The lack of facial information hidden behind a mask might
affect the neural circuits underwriting face perception and
affect recognition. Yet, little is known about alterations in brain
communication elicited by face covering. It is hypothesized that
such an unusual visual experience as daily reading masked
faces may trigger a reset mechanism, a renewed ability of the
neural networks to undergo a long-term plasticity adaptation
(Ferrari et al. 2021; Fig. 6). Long-term usage of face masks can
foster experience-dependent synaptic plasticity underpinning
face reading. Clarification of the specificity of the neural
networks
underlying
reading
covered
faces
(as
compared
with unmasked faces) calls for tailored research, which can
be guided (at least, partly) by the outcome of earlier brain
imaging and lesion studies focusing on reading in the eyes (see
Aberrant Reading in the Eyes and Brain Networks Underwriting
Reading Covered Faces Sections below).
Some voices and experimental work endorse using transpar-
ent face masks that may help to avoid social distress (Mheidly
et al. 2020; Ferrari et al. 2021; Gil and Arroyo-Anlló 2021) and
collateral harm, sparing the capability to read facial emotions
and evaluate personal attribution (Marini et al. 2021). Never-
theless, even transparent masks (TMs) negatively affect face

Figure 6. Visual sensory inputs from faces are encoded by the specialized facial networks. At the systems level (a), this process implies functional and structural
engagement of multiple brain regions, whereas at cellular level (b), this promotes the induction of distinct forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation
(LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), upper panel. Wearing face masks reduces the amount of information available. Ferrari et al. (2021) suggest that both at the
systems and cellular levels, this impairs long-term functional and structural plasticity. In particular, at the synaptic level, LTP induction would be favored, whereas
LTD would be impaired. The black traces indicate the excitatory postsynaptic potentials in unmasked conditions; the red traces represent the long-term changes in

identification (Marini et al. 2021). Another related concern is how
effective are TMs in source control (preventing infected persons
from transmitting the virus to others) as well as a protective
tool to wearers. Possible coping and compensation strategies
are also in focus of current research (Mheidly et al. 2020; Mol-
nar-Szakacs et al. 2021). For instance, it is reported that the use
of portrait photos with smiling faces (in addition to surgical
masks) positively influences patients’ estimation of healthcare
staff wearing masks: it affects ratings of staff friendliness, but
not medical quality of treatment or how well patients feel during
treatment (Wiesmann et al. 2021).
Reading Covered Faces and the RMET
The eyes region plays a particularly vital role in inferring
people’s affective and mental states. Even very short exposure
(12.5 ms) is sufficient for emotion recognition in the eyes
(Schmidtmann et al. 2020). Although only first steps toward
exploring of reading covered faces have been made so far,
novel valuable insights can be attained inspecting the RMET
(Baron-Cohen et al. 2001), widely used in clinical and neu-
rotypical populations. The standard RMET consists of a set
of 36 black-and-white photographs of female and male pairs
of eyes (primarily taken from the UK newspapers) along with
the corresponding part of a face (portions of surrounding
regions including hair style and gaze directions; Fig. 7) with
four response options (adjectives describing emotional and
mental states) per each item including the correct one. Though
the RMET is often criticized for heavy reliance on proficient
language
command
and
vocabulary
comprehension
(e.g.,
Olderbak et al. 2015; Kittel et al. 2021), the test had been
intended to tap affective components of social cognition. The
data collected by using the RMET shed light on reading faces
covered by masks, as comparable amount of visual information
is accessible.
Social Skills Predict Efficient Reading of Covered Faces
Our ability to read in the eyes assessed by the RMET is linked
to self-reported empathy and artistic attitudes (Guariglia et al.
2015; Olderbak and Wilhelm 2017; Eddy and Hansen 2020) as well
as to emotional intelligence (Megías-Robles et al. 2020). In addi-
tion, reading in the eyes is closely related to emotion perception
from whole-seen faces (Kittel et al. 2021). RMET performance is

associated with alexithymia (the inability to identify emotions
in the self), and individuals with lower RMET scores are more
likely to express aggression (Lee, Nam, et al. 2020). Collectivism is
positively related to RMET scores in Palestinian, but not in Italian
or German adolescents (Hünefeldt et al. 2021). Reading emotions
and affective states in the eyes is firmly connected with other
social skills such as body language reading (Alaerts et al. 2011;
Miller and Saygin 2013), although this tie appears to be gender-
specific, occurring in females solely (Isernia et al. 2020). Already
in children aged 7–12 years, accuracy of reading in the eyes is
associated with the sensitivity to human body motion (Rice et
al. 2016).
Brain Networks Underwriting Reading Covered Faces
Mounting brain imaging data (primarily, structural and func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and lesion studies)
delivers converging evidence in favor of the social brain
engagement in the RMET. In particular, such key structures of
the social brain as the superior temporal sulcus (STS), amygdala,
temporo-parietal junction, and insula in the right hemisphere
are strongly engaged (Baron-Cohen et al. 1999; Adams et al.
2010; Moor et al. 2012; Schurz et al. 2014; Overgaauw et al.
2015). Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between
the posterior STS and amygdala predicts RMET performance
(Yin et al. 2018; Fig. 8).
Parcel-based lesion-symptom mapping, white-matter tract-
wise statistical analysis, and disconnectome symptom mapping
in stroke patients reveal that low RMET scores are associated
with damage to the right posterior frontal gyrus and insula as
well as with disconnectivity in white-matter tracts between the
frontal and temporo-parietal regions (Domínguez et al. 2019;
Fig. 8). Fractional anisotropy (FA) of the right-hemispheric unci-
nate fasciculus, an association fiber tract connecting the right
frontal and anterior temporal lobes and known to support social
decision making, is also intimately tied with RMET scoring (Coad
et al. 2020). Involvement of brain areas underpinning social deci-
sion making such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)
is also broadly reported (Moor et al. 2012; Overgaauw et al.
2015; Sato et al. 2016; Domínguez et al. 2019). To the best of
our knowledge, no comparison had been made between the
neural networks subserving reading whole-seen and covered
faces (see also Neural Engagement in Reading Faces Covered by
Masks Section above). Yet, it appears plausible that reading
partially covered faces requires more attentional resources and
greater decision-making load as well as stronger engagement of
the brain networks underwriting these abilities. The other way
around, individuals with deficient neural circuits underpinning
these capabilities may be expected to display difficulties in
reading covered faces.
Aberrant Reading in the Eyes
Reading emotions and mental states in the eyes is substantially
impaired in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders charac-
terized by alterations in social cognition and nonverbal commu-
nication such as autism (Baron-Cohen et al. 2001; Baribeau et
al. 2015; Del Valle Rubido et al. 2018; Peñuelas-Calvo et al. 2019).
This disadvantage is cross-cultural in its nature, occurring, for
example, in autistic children from Kolkata, India (Rudra et al.
2016). In the neurotypical population, individuals with higher
autistic traits also display weaker RMET performance (Gökçen
et al. 2014). RMET scores are lower in schizophrenia including
patients with first episode of psychosis (Fernandes et al. 2018;
García-Fernández et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020; Oliver et al. 2021),
MDD and social anxiety disorders (Maleki et al. 2020), and alex-
ithymia (Oakley et al. 2016; Rødgaard et al. 2019). Children with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–
compulsive disorder (OCD) are also impaired (Baribeau et al.
2015). Notably, across children with ASD, ADHD, and OCD, RMET
deficits are associated with smaller amygdala/hippocampal vol-
umes (Baribeau et al. 2015).
Patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (Heitz et al. 2016),
multiple sclerosis (Cotter et al. 2016), behavioral variant of fron-
totemporal dementia, bvFTD (Pardini et al. 2013; Schroeter et
al. 2018), Huntington’s disease (Bayliss et al. 2019), Parkinson’s
disease (Orso et al. 2020), and older individuals with mild cog-
nitive impairment (Michaelian et al. 2019) exhibit difficulties
on the RMET. This shows that reading covered faces may be
quite challenging for individuals not only with neuropsychiatric,
neurological, and neurodevelopmental conditions characterized
by altered social cognition, but also for patients with other
deficits such as limited attentional resources. In a nutshell, in
harmony with brain imaging, the clinical findings reveal that
not only the social brain per se but also the neural circuits
supporting attention, decision making, and social behavior are
required for efficient reading of covered faces.
Gender/Sex Specificity
In accordance with research on masked faces (Reading Covered
Faces: Accuracy, Misinterpretation, and Perceptual Bias Section
above), females are repeatedly reported to be more proficient on
the RMET (Baron-Cohen et al. 2001; Isernia et al. 2020; Megías-
Robles et al. 2020; Kynast et al. 2021), though overperformance
on the RMET might be also connected with well-developed
language
skills
(Olderbak
et
al. 2015;
Kittel
et
al. 2021).
Female superiority in RMET performance is modulated by
difficulty/ambiguity of the items (Guariglia et al. 2015) but
appears to be rather independent of culture (Hünefeldt et al.
2021). Recent evidence shows that merely observer’s gender

rather than neurobiological sex, impacts reading in the eyes
on the RMET (Vonk et al. 2016). In accord with this, testosterone
administration to young women does not affect RMET scoring
(Carré et al. 2015). By involving transgender women/men, a lower
level of RMET performance is found in transgender men and
nonbinary assigned females at birth than in females in the
general population (Kung 2020).
Impact of Culture and Age
Accuracy of reading in the eyes is higher when emotions and
mental states are expressed and recognized by the same ethnic
group, though a cultural in-group effect is modulated by the
amount of exposure to the cultural out-group. For instance, diffi-
culties on the RMET (comprising images of Caucasians selected

from the UK newspapers and magazines) are more pronounced
in those Singaporean individuals who have had less contact with
Caucasians (Martin et al. 2021). In line with this, Palestinian
participants score lower on the standard RMET than German
and Italian individuals (Hünefeldt et al. 2021). Functional MRI in
Caucasian Americans and native Japanese adults reveals greater
bilateral recruitment of the posterior STS during same- versus
other-culture RMET performance in both cultural groups (Adams
et al. 2010).
Nonverbal visual social cognition is widely believed to remain
intact in elderly (Moran 2013; Natelson Love et al. 2015; Reiter
et al. 2017), though some dissociation occurs between cognitive
and affective components (Wang and Su 2013). In accord with
this, only a slight or moderate declination with age is reported
on the RMET (Henry et al. 2013; Cabinio et al. 2015), though
age-related drops in RMET performance can happen as early as
in the fifth decade of life (Pardini and Nichelli 2009). Despite the
relatively preserved ability for reading in the eyes with age (from
20 to 79 years), an age-related decrease in gray matter volume
occurs in a number of brain areas (such as the left superior tem-
poral gyrus, bilateral posterior insula, and left inferior frontal
gyrus) along with progressive white matter disconnection of the
temporo-parietal portions of the brain (Cabinio et al. 2015; Fig. 9).
Age-related decline appears to be profoundly modulated by
individual differences: with increasing age, the RMET scoring
variance increases in both men and women (Kynast et al. 2021).
In older adults, RMET scores are higher with younger age, educa-
tion, cognitive screening scores, literacy, and social norms scores
(Chander et al. 2020; Dodell-Feder et al. 2020; Lee, Jacobsen,
et al. 2020). Finally, most recent research indicates the lack of
declination or even an increase in RMET scores in healthy aging
(Dodell-Feder et al. 2020; Yıldırım et al. 2020).
Résumé
In a nutshell, au fait research on reading partially covered
faces reveals that: 1) Wearing medical masks hampers facial
affect recognition, though inferring basic emotional expressions
remains reliable. 2) By buffering both positive and negative facial
affect, face masks dampen veridical evaluation of counterparts
that may lead to inefficient or even perplexing interpersonal
interaction. 3) Faces covered by masks have a certain signal
function introducing perceptual biases such as mask wearers
can be perceived as either more socially desirable, bizarre or
even unhealthy depending on the context. 4) Masks may affect
perceived face attractiveness decreasing the attractiveness
ratings of good-looking female and male faces and ameliorating
the ratings of less attractive faces. 5) Reading covered faces is
gender- and age-specific, being more challenging for males and
variable even in healthy aging. 6) The hampering effect of face
masks on social cognition is likely to be cross-cultural, occurring
all over the globe. Reading faces wearing masks is culturally
shaped, and people who are accustomed to reading partly veiled
faces may be less affected. 7) Reading covered faces is likely to be
supported by the large-scale neural circuits, involving not only
the social brain, but more widely spread neural communication
engaging the networks underwriting attentional resources and
social decision making. Clarifying the issue of how masks
affect face reading in real life, where we deal with dynamic
faces and have entrée to additional social signals such as
body language, calls for further tailored research. Investigation
of the neural networks underlying reading covered faces (as
compared with unmasked faces) can be guided by the outcome
of earlier brain imaging and lesion studies focusing on reading in
the eyes.

Benefits of wearing masks in preventing virus transmis-
sion likely outweigh the collateral burdens for social cognition,
communication, and interaction. Yet, the community has to be
aware of potential collateral unintended effects of medical man-
dates on nonverbal social cognition, particularly, in elderly and
preschool age, neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions,
and professional domains closely related to social interaction
and communication such as education and health care. Atten-
tion should be paid to early development of face reading, in
particular, during transient sensitive periods and critical time
windows. Special efforts should be directed at evaluation, inter-
vention, and training of social skills and reading faces covered
by masks. Exploration of social cognition under the current
pandemic provides novel valuable insights for the integration
of social signals from faces and bodies and using more subtle
sources of social information such as reading in the eyes.
